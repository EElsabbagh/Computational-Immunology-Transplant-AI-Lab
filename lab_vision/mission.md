# CITA Lab – Mission

Over the next 5–10 years, the Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab (CITA Lab) will:

1. **Map Immune Recovery After HCT**  
   Use single-cell RNA sequencing, flow/cyto, and immune repertoire data to characterize how 
   T, B, NK, and myeloid cells recover in children after hematopoietic cell transplantation.

2. **Predict Transplant Outcomes Using AI**  
   Develop calibrated, interpretable machine learning models that integrate immune and 
   clinical features to predict GVHD, relapse, viral reactivation, graft failure, and 
   delayed immune reconstitution.

3. **Decode Mechanisms of Immune Dysregulation**  
   Apply systems immunology, trajectory analysis, and TCR/BCR repertoire methods to identify 
   pathways that drive immune failure or durable tolerance after transplant.

4. **Build Clinically Useful Tools**  
   Translate models into risk scores, visual dashboards, and decision aids that can be used 
   by transplant clinicians in real-world settings.

5. **Advance Global Equity in Transplant Precision Medicine**  
   Prioritize open-source methods, collaborations with centers in low- and middle-income 
   countries, and educational resources that lower the barrier to entry for computational 
   immunology in transplantation.
