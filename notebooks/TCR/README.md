# TCR Repertoire Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks for T-cell receptor repertoire analysis, including:

- Data loading from public TCR datasets (iReceptor, AIRR)
- CDR3 extraction
- Diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson)
- Clonality measures
- Repertoire convergence
- Linking TCR features to immune phenotypes

These notebooks support the lab’s work on relapse and immune recovery modeling.
